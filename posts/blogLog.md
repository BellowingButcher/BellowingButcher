## Week One
- Was my first week what I expected, *why* or *why not*?
- What are you **excited** or **eager** to learn more about?
- What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

The first week was a big change for me.  I felt a hodge-podge of emotions during the first week.
- Confusion
- Dispare
- Excitement
- Envy
- Joy

I did expect to have a wide array of emotions. This is due to the learning curve I need to overcome.  I haven't tryed to study or learn in a classroom setting for several years now.
Getting those portions of my brain back up and running is a bit stressful.
### Excitement and Eagerness

Some things that excite me are
- Working with the command line
- Being able to build and syle a blog
- Showing off my work to the coding buddies I have

### Forbiden knowlegde

For a time I was going to the University of Kentucky to be a forester.  During this time I was in the forestry club. We would do different competitions against other state colleges. 
I had a blast competing for UK. The events that I competed in were
- Cross-cut saw
- Bow saw
- Axe and Knife throwing
- Archery

Coming from a very outdoorsy childhood I fit right into the club.

## Week Number Two

Q: *What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?*

> I would like to be able to make an interactive calculator for my website.

Q: *What are you struggling with?*

> The time it takes me to digest all the reading is a bit longer than I want it to be.

Q: *How do you solve a problem?*

> If I haven't encountered this problem before, or one like it, I search for wisdom on the problem.  Either through my Mom and Dad, through my coding friend group, or even give it an ole Google.

Q: *What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?*

> I like to focus my mind else where if I'm really stuck on a problem.  It helps to leave the problem and come back to it later with a fresh start.

## Week Number 4

Q: What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

> It gave me a little freedom to be able to go to my parents house and let them visit with my son more often.  But for me that was a little tougher becuase I am starting from almost zero experience with a computer.  The most I understood before this class was playing games on them.  I am glad that I was able to go in on site when I was really stuck.

Q: What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

> A lot was due to my son getting sick and not being able to go to school.  Its really hard to find child care that will take care of a sick toddler.  My wife is a manager of a team at a grocery store and has to work extra hours at the moment due to some staff issues and what not.  So that left it up to me to watch him during school hours and then my sister inlaw thankfully helped me in the afternoons.  Giving me some time to get my work done.


Q: How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

> I had to eat the elephant one bite at a time.

### Week 5

Q: What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

> The kata logic is sometimes more than I can understand how to solve.  My brain isn't used to having to solve those problems as of late.  I've had a labor job that works my physical self and my managing people skill but nothing much else than that in problem solving.  

Q: What is the one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

> I think that I am just scratching the surface of some major opportunity.  I've never thought much about how a computer works, or anything about them really other than just playing games on them. Barely even that too.  Learning the complexities just never end with JavaScript and how it can interact with ones and zeros.  Styling things has never really  been a strong suit of mine.  I don't have that great design eye. I know how it makes me feel when I see some colors together, but visual art has never been my path of creativity.  So just learning how to make styling simple is good for me. It seems that bootstrap is a way to make css simple.  To speak of Atomic Design, I think that it's interesting to think of the psychology that is behind how the human eye follows an invisible path on a screen.  Learning what the best paths to lay seems like a good skill to have.

Q: How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?

> For me In-Person Bootcamp gives me the chance to patch the holes that were in my foundational knowledge.  Maybe even to the extent that I would say they provided some of the main support beams for my frame work.  Starting from nothing seems easy until you look around and see that you have to speak sanscrit to be able to use the screwdriver, speak latin to use the screws, and then speak english to have acess to the wood to screw together.  If you use your fingers to turn the screw into the wood, it'll work, but your fingers are going to be bleeding by the end.

Q: What is your 'Why'?

> 'Family' __ Dominic Toretto

Q: What does it mean to develop good code?

> A good developer is always in maintenance mode.  Always finding an efficient pathway to the problem solution. 

Q: What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
