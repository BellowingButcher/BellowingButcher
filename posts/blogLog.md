## Week One
- Was my first week what I expected, *why* or *why not*?
- What are you **excited** or **eager** to learn more about?
- What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

The first week was a big change for me.  I felt a hodge-podge of emotions during the first week.
- Confusion
- Dispare
- Excitement
- Envy
- Joy

I did expect to have a wide array of emotions. This is due to the learning curve I need to overcome.  I haven't tryed to study or learn in a classroom setting for several years now.
Getting those portions of my brain back up and running is a bit stressful.
### Excitement and Eagerness

Some things that excite me are
- Working with the command line
- Being able to build and syle a blog
- Showing off my work to the coding buddies I have

### Forbiden knowlegde

For a time I was going to the University of Kentucky to be a forester.  During this time I was in the forestry club. We would do different competitions against other state colleges. 
I had a blast competing for UK. The events that I competed in were
- Cross-cut saw
- Bow saw
- Axe and Knife throwing
- Archery

Coming from a very outdoorsy childhood I fit right into the club.

> I would like to be able to make an interactive calculator for my website.

Q: *What are you struggling with?*

> The time it takes me to digest all the reading is a bit longer than I want it to be.

Q: *How do you solve a problem?*

> If I haven't encountered this problem before, or one like it, I search for wisdom on the problem.  Either through my Mom and Dad, through my coding friend group, or even give it an ole Google.

Q: *What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?*

> I like to focus my mind else where if I'm really stuck on a problem.  It helps to leave the problem and come back to it later with a fresh start.

## Week Number 4

Q: What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

> It gave me a little freedom to be able to go to my parents house and let them visit with my son more often.  But for me that was a little tougher becuase I am starting from almost zero experience with a computer.  The most I understood before this class was playing games on them.  I am glad that I was able to go in on site when I was really stuck.

Q: What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

> A lot was due to my son getting sick and not being able to go to school.  Its really hard to find child care that will take care of a sick toddler.  My wife is a manager of a team at a grocery store and has to work extra hours at the moment due to some staff issues and what not.  So that left it up to me to watch him during school hours and then my sister inlaw thankfully helped me in the afternoons.  Giving me some time to get my work done.


Q: How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

> I had to eat the elephant one bite at a time.
