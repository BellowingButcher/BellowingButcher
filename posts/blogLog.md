## Week One
- Was my first week what I expected, *why* or *why not*?
- What are you **excited** or **eager** to learn more about?
- What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

The first week was a big change for me.  I felt a hodge-podge of emotions during the first week.
- Confusion
- Dispare
- Excitement
- Envy
- Joy

I did expect to have a wide array of emotions. This is due to the learning curve I need to overcome.  I haven't tryed to study or learn in a classroom setting for several years now.
Getting those portions of my brain back up and running is a bit stressful.
### Excitement and Eagerness

Some things that excite me are
- Working with the command line
- Being able to build and syle a blog
- Showing off my work to the coding buddies I have

### Forbiden knowlegde

For a time I was going to the University of Kentucky to be a forester.  During this time I was in the forestry club. We would do different competitions against other state colleges. 
I had a blast competing for UK. The events that I competed in were
- Cross-cut saw
- Bow saw
- Axe and Knife throwing
- Archery

Coming from a very outdoorsy childhood I fit right into the club.

## Week Number Two

Q: *What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?*
> I would like to be able to make an interactive calculator for my website.

Q: *What are you struggling with?*
> The time it takes me to digest all the reading is a bit longer than I want it to be.

Q: *How do you solve a problem?*
> If I haven't encountered this problem before, or one like it, I search for wisdom on the problem.  Either through my Mom and Dad, through my coding friend group, or even give it an ole Google.

Q: *What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?*
> I like to focus my mind else where if I'm really stuck on a problem.  It helps to leave the problem and come back to it later with a fresh start.
