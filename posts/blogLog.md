## Week One
- Was my first week what I expected, *why* or *why not*?
- What are you **excited** or **eager** to learn more about?
- What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

The first week was a big change for me.  I felt a hodge-podge of emotions during the first week.
- Confusion
- Dispare
- Excitement
- Envy
- Joy

I did expect to have a wide array of emotions. This is due to the learning curve I need to overcome.  I haven't tryed to study or learn in a classroom setting for several years now.
Getting those portions of my brain back up and running is a bit stressful.
### Excitement and Eagerness

Some things that excite me are
- Working with the command line
- Being able to build and syle a blog
- Showing off my work to the coding buddies I have

### Forbiden knowlegde

For a time I was going to the University of Kentucky to be a forester.  During this time I was in the forestry club. We would do different competitions against other state colleges. 
I had a blast competing for UK. The events that I competed in were
- Cross-cut saw
- Bow saw
- Axe and Knife throwing
- Archery

Coming from a very outdoorsy childhood I fit right into the club.

## Week Number Two

Q: *What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?*

> I would like to be able to make an interactive calculator for my website.

Q: *What are you struggling with?*

> The time it takes me to digest all the reading is a bit longer than I want it to be.

Q: *How do you solve a problem?*

> If I haven't encountered this problem before, or one like it, I search for wisdom on the problem.  Either through my Mom and Dad, through my coding friend group, or even give it an ole Google.

Q: *What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?*

> I like to focus my mind else where if I'm really stuck on a problem.  It helps to leave the problem and come back to it later with a fresh start.

## Week Number 4

Q: What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

> It gave me a little freedom to be able to go to my parents house and let them visit with my son more often.  But for me that was a little tougher becuase I am starting from almost zero experience with a computer.  The most I understood before this class was playing games on them.  I am glad that I was able to go in on site when I was really stuck.

Q: What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

> A lot was due to my son getting sick and not being able to go to school.  Its really hard to find child care that will take care of a sick toddler.  My wife is a manager of a team at a grocery store and has to work extra hours at the moment due to some staff issues and what not.  So that left it up to me to watch him during school hours and then my sister inlaw thankfully helped me in the afternoons.  Giving me some time to get my work done.


Q: How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

> I had to eat the elephant one bite at a time.

### Week 5
---

Q: What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

> The kata logic is sometimes more than I can understand how to solve.  My brain isn't used to having to solve those problems as of late.  I've had a labor job that works my physical self and my managing people skill but nothing much else than that in problem solving.  

Q: What is the one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

> I think that I am just scratching the surface of some major opportunity.  I've never thought much about how a computer works, or anything about them really other than just playing games on them. Barely even that too.  Learning the complexities just never end with JavaScript and how it can interact with ones and zeros.  Styling things has never really  been a strong suit of mine.  I don't have that great design eye. I know how it makes me feel when I see some colors together, but visual art has never been my path of creativity.  So just learning how to make styling simple is good for me. It seems that bootstrap is a way to make css simple.  To speak of Atomic Design, I think that it's interesting to think of the psychology that is behind how the human eye follows an invisible path on a screen.  Learning what the best paths to lay seems like a good skill to have.

Q: How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?

> For me In-Person Bootcamp gives me the chance to patch the holes that were in my foundational knowledge.  Maybe even to the extent that I would say they provided some of the main support beams for my frame work.  Starting from nothing seems easy until you look around and see that you have to speak sanscrit to be able to use the screwdriver, speak latin to use the screws, and then speak english to have acess to the wood to screw together.  If you use your fingers to turn the screw into the wood, it'll work, but your fingers are going to be bleeding by the end.

Q: What is your 'Why'?

> 'Family' __ Dominic Toretto

### Week 6
---

Q: What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

>  This week we covered the MOSCOW list.  It was a beneficial tool for keeping my mind focused on what the project should have in it compared to the time I have available to work on it.  It keeps you from wasting time on features that would be cool, but not needed.

Q: What does it mean to develop good code?

> To me, developing good code means that you have an efficient way of solving the problems that you set out to face.

Q: What does it mean to be a good developer?

> A good developer is always in maintenance mode.  Always finding an efficient pathway to the problem solution. 

Q: What is one thing that programmers hate doing?

> Wasting time.

### Week 8

Q: Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

> I think that they have their use cases.  But as a noobie, I am not yet tired of doing things the long way yet.  Writing it out helps me understand what is going on in the code.  

Q: What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?

> I haven't done any research into any other libraries than React.  I am unsure of any that I would be interested in.

Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.

### Week 9
---

Q: What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?

> Yes they are scary.  They have the potential to overwrite a lot of work done by others. Or sending files to the incorrect area, those files may contain some sensitive information.  When you download a package then you are downloading any possible problems with that package as well.  

Q: If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?

> I would want an interface that uploads and installs all the correct packages to your project that you are wanting to use, maybe with a prompt to ask what your tech stack is. Has a list of recommended packages that you can choose if you want to download them. Then also sets up a base repo with the correct files and pathways already linked in those files. HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, etc..

Q: List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code

> The first one I was able to come up with is any video games.  There are a lot of variables to deal with when you are working with an application the size of a game.  It could range from half a million to hundreds of millions of lines of code for a triple A game.  Without a specific way to interact with those variables and also pre-built helper functions that were designed by experts.  That many lines of code to manage as a single developer would be impossible.

### Week 10

Q: Now that you are halfway through boot-camp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?

> The biggest hurdle that I have is and always has been is myself. I tend to get stuck in a bad cycle that resembles the feed back loop that you get when you bring a microphone too close to the speaker that the sound is emitting from.  The screech that you first heard is picked up by the microphone and then amplified by the speaker. Which is then picked up by the microphone again. You get the loop.  Once I get down on myself or just depressed because the task ahead looks so giant that the steps needed to climb that giant task seem to never end.  On top of that the step that I am on doesn't really have a solid foundation. I can't seem to be ok with just leaving that step all wibbly wobbly for now I must make it sturdy and able to handle my fat ass when I come back to step on this project again.

Q: Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?

> I only have one idea so far.  I am still brainstorming for some others.  It is the same idea I had when applying for the camp.  It is an A.I. that watches a fiat coin and makes purchases based on if the coin is above or bellow the current value of a dollar.  I am thinking possibly a type of text based game. Puzzle or rpg would be the two types I would think of.  But I don't really know if that will be an acceptable project.  I don't have an idea for a third yet. It's in the process of being formulated though.

Q: What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript? 

> I am surprised at how much more it seemed to click into place.  I have a small foundation of a velcro wall now to stick new information to.  It was very encouraging finding this out.  I was having a pretty rough time mentally before the start of this week.  I was getting pretty depressed about the state of my design projects.  Now, it is feeling like I have more mental energy to be able to dedicate it to the thoughts that the blog posts require as well as the thought that designing a page that represents me as a person and also demonstrates my coding skill for any possible employers to be impressed with takes.  With the first weeks of JavaScript I felt like I was drowning because not only were we learning 3 languages but we were learning the concepts of programing and how programing works in general.

### Week 11

Q: What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?

> Some similarities are the fact that they both use a form of 'pseudocode' as a way to structure the logic side of a problem you are trying to solve.  Both languages contain loops, conditional statements, functions, and even have a specific structure that you must follow for the computer to know what you want it to do.  What words you use to convey what you want the computer to do are different.  The structure to how you lay your code out is different.  JavaScript is more loose where python is more ridged.

Q: If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?

> I'm not sure what would be different.  I think starting with JS is a good thing.  It is more basic in language and needs more direction from you as the coder.  You have to walk the computer almost step by step in JS.  Python is a bit more "hand-wavey".  For example, this is what you need to type to loop through something 5 times for JS: "for (let i=0; i<=5; i++)".  In contrast, python is: For x in range(0,6).  Way easier to read and way more simple to write.  So in conclusion I think it is better to learn the more nitty gritty details before allowing yourself to move up in a level of abstraction.

Q: Think of a project or tech-based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future? 

>  Oh yeah! I can see it more clearly.  Not super clear of course.  There are a lot of aspects that I am unaware of and also dont have cemented in understanding.  But on the whole, I do understand how websites are accessing databases.  An Ahh Hah moment (moment of clarity), for me was how the filter buttons on search bars gather and sort information based on what you want.

### Week 12

Q: What are you struggling with the most in the Tech Stack so far and why?

> The thing that I struggle with the most is the lack of time I am able to spend on each individual piece of the tech stack.  The next struggle I think of is the complexity that code can have with just a few short keystrokes.  Complexity is something that I need time to understand how each piece of the code fits into the complex puzzle of a program.

Q: What companies or people (local or not) would you like to hear talk during a Bootcamp lunch and learn?

> I am unfamiliar with any of the tech companies around lexington.  I do remember hearing about one called VR Together.  The things they are doing there really speak to me.  Giving elderly people the capability to keep in touch with their family from where ever they are is something that rings true to my feelings.

Q: After having built your first full-stack application, what things in your repertoire are a sticking point for you? Were you able to reconnect your React Restaurant to your Backend Bistro code? If so, what was that like, and if not, what hurdles did you need to jump?

> I keep thinking back to JavaScript. It may be a sticking point for me because we spent so much time on it.  I did tones of studying and note taking on it.  So I feel more at home in JavaScript at this moment.  That is because of how much more time I was able to spend in the learning process.  I like how it has the capability of doing backend and front end work.  Also anytime you hear about coding you always hear about JavaScript.
