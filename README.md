### "Hello there" _ Obie-Wan Kenobie ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on a calculator.
I am learning the in's and out's of the command line interface.
I am also in the process of learning how to make compost for gardens on a larger than average scale.
I was a butcher for about 6 years, if you are interested in talking about it let me know.
The best way to get ahold of me would be through email, bellowingbutcher@gmail.com.
A fun fact about me is that I have a 10 inch titanium plate holding my ankle together with 12 screws.
Ask me about it sometime =]
