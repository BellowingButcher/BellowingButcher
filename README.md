### "Hello there" _ Obie-Wan Kenobie ðŸ‘‹
- I am currently working on my basic knowlgedge in computer coding.

- I am in the process of learning how to make compost for gardens on a larger than average scale.

- I was a butcher for about 6 years, if you are interested in talking about it let me know.

- The best way to get ahold of me would be through email, bellowingbutcher@gmail.com.

- A fun fact about me is that I have a 10 inch titanium plate holding my ankle together with 12 screws.
Ask me about it sometime =]
